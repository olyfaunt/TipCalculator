TipCalculator
=============

Although this was one of the simplest apps I wrote, I really liked its real life utility. 
I enjoy going to dim sum or dinner ever so often with a large group of friends;
we always end up splitting the bill equally and one friend is a stickler for calculating the tip on top of the bill before tax. 
This app gives you a default 15% tip option and a custom tip option that you can fill in.

Iâ€™m working on a multiple-tabbed version which would have tabs for: 
-solo-dining, 
-liquor tax & tip, 
-settings for different tax rates by province, as well as 
-an option to round results to the nearest 5 cents, since Canada recently got rid of the penny.
